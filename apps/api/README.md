# API

## Purpose

This application provides the HTTP backend for the Industrial AI Agent
portfolio project.

## Implemented

- FastAPI application factory;
- environment-based application settings;
- `GET /health` process-health contract;
- synchronous SQLAlchemy and SQLite session foundation;
- explicit Alembic migration workflow;
- persisted Conversation model with UUID identifiers and UTC timestamps;
- Conversation create, list, get, and permanent-delete endpoints;
- Pytest and Ruff verification; and
- reproducible uv lockfile and package build.

## Setup

From `apps/api`:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

## Database migrations

The default local database is `apps/api/industrial_agent.db` when commands are
run from `apps/api`. Apply and reverse schema state explicitly:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic downgrade base
```

API startup does not run migrations or create schema objects.

## Run

```bash
uv run uvicorn industrial_agent.main:app \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8000 \
  --reload
```

The process-health endpoint is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`.

## Conversation API

Apply the latest migration before using these endpoints. A title is optional;
when omitted, it defaults to `New conversation`. Supplied titles are trimmed
and must contain between 1 and 200 characters.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Yield investigation"}'

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversations

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversations/<conversation-id>

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversations/<conversation-id>
```

The list returns every Conversation, with the newest records first. Deletion
is permanent. There is currently no update, rename, archive, restore, or
pagination operation.

## Verify

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv build
```

## Remaining v0.1 responsibilities

- message HTTP APIs and persistence;
- one OpenAI-compatible LLM adapter;
- configuration validation and explicit error handling; and
- tests for the remaining backend behavior.

## Non-responsibilities

LangGraph, RAG, MCP, manufacturing analytics, production tools, authentication,
streaming, and distributed deployment are outside v0.1.

## Dependency management

Backend metadata and runtime dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`.
Development tools are kept in a separate dependency group, and `uv.lock`
records the resolved environment.

## Current limitations

The API persists Conversation records, but does not yet persist messages,
produce assistant responses, call an LLM, or expose manufacturing data. The
health endpoint reports API-process availability only and does not check the
database.
